"introduction":
"The name tells everything. The gallery is always full of carefully selective works and well constructed functions. It’s more like a displaying platform rather than a gallery because you perhaps think gallery are for “art” only. You may think differently depends on how you define ‘art’. Or you may learn the new definition of art in here. ",
